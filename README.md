In challenge 2, i was assigned to create a employee's portfolio. I was successfully complete this request. Website displays developer’s name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. Navigation links scrolls to the corresponding sections when clicked. Added titled images of the developer’s applications and made the recent application image larger than the older projects. When click on the recent application, new tab opens and takes to the deployed application. Followed responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
